# inband
A Template for Stateless Networking and Coordination (no, the other kind of state.)

State[1] systems (companies, governments, banks, churches, clubs, schools, charities, armies, unions, etc.) have leveraged computers and networks for increased efficiency and capacity in performing their functions. Of a necessity, the structure of the information systems reify the structure of the implementing organization.

The band, tribe, clan, and autonomous collective may also benefit from computers and networks but the basic concepts of information management used in modern computing systems (user/administrator, viewer/contributor/moderator, access control lists of any sort) introduce the state into a previously stateless system in conflict with efforts to avoid the imposition.

An information system that grants the band of freely cooperating individuals the same increased efficiency and capacity in reaching shared goals can be developed by codifying the interactions that maintain the group identity without differentiating individuals into state organs. 

The Inband software with the 'band' protocol is an attempt to provide a framework for such an information system.

[1] Wherein power is alienated from or accrued to the individual via structural relationship to the group as opposed to revokable delegation.

// DESIGN

// An Id is formed by creating a private/public key pair and taking the shah of a
// cert  with the private key.

// If the Id is for a band then it  makes a claim with its Id as the By, Er, and Ee and the name as the St.
// The band's private key may then be discarded as it should never be used again.

// The private key should be kept for an individual rather than a band. The private key should not be transmitted.

// A claim of association takes the Idshahs of a (claim)By of (claim)Er to (claim)Ee and the Sdshah of a Stmt (St) and
// produces a Seal of the By-pkey-signed Affirm + C + Er + Ee + St.

// A band will have its founders when at least two Ids symmetrically make and exchange 'in' upvote claims
// of association with each other's Ee the band's Er

// Each individual will also create their own name claim.

// an individual may change their name by making a new name claim and downvoting their old one.
// nicnames are when an individual makes a name claim for someone else.

// individuals can claim or have bestowed on them other things such as email addresses, phone numbers, titles, etc.
// other individuals can dispute the claims.

// Global history is not maintained but an individual may keep and share a 'diary' of personal history

// A 'in upvote' is the Stmt.Said "IN" and Affirm is 'true'. 'in downvote' is the same but where 'affirm' is false.
// A claim with the same By, Er, Ee, and St but a higher-numbered C supplants earlier claims with teh same By, Er, Ee, and St.

// An Id may be considered to be a member so long as it has more upvotes than downvotes by other members. This is a circular relation.

// Other relastionships may be described between two individuals.

// A Moot is when an Ident has a Visit with several other Idents requesting new Claims from them.

// Anyone can Moot. Someone who Moots a lot might be made a leader, or might be downvoted out of the band to stop the bother.

// Claims are affirmative or negative.

// a Dog is an automaton with an Id that acts on its view of the consensus of the band.

// An individual identity

// a role is just another name for a person
// SPONSOR shah + AFFIRM shah Topic name == introduce person as name
// name can be a utf8 string or a gif or a jpeg or a ring-tone or...

// When mooted by a mooter regarding a claim, the mootee can affirm true or false or decline to reply.
// It is expected that if a mootee has affirmed a leader and the leader is a mooter then the mootee should not decline to reply.

// some CLAIMs: (format: Id(claimant) affirm Id(individual) Shah(stmt) Id(individual|band)|Shah(stmt)
// IN:        claimaint says individual 'IN' band
// <DUTY>:    claimaint says individual 'SPEAKER'|'LEADER'|'SCAPEGOAT'|'COOK'|'CLERK'|'PROGNOSTICATOR'|'<whatever>' for band
// <STATUS>:  claimaint says individual 'SAGE'|'CONTRIBUTOR'|'JOURNEYMAN'|'BRO/SIS'|'ELDER'|'FULL-MEMBER'|'ELECT'|'COMPETENT'|'DUES-PAID'|'<something>' in band
// MY,<ROLE>: claimaint says individual 'MY' 'FRIEND'|'PARTNER'|'MENTOR'
// NAME:      claimaint says claimant 'NAME' '<name>'
// EMAIL:     claimaint says claimant 'EMAIL' '<email address>'
// IP:        claimaint says claimant 'IP' '<ip address>'
// NICNAME:   claimaint says individual 'NAME' '<name>'

// convention determines the meaning and usefullness of claims.
// automation may reify convention.
// claim evaluation happens locally by individuals or dogs (automated individuals.)
